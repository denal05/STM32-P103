			INSTALLATION

1. Run Olimex-GCCFD-240907.EXE and follow the wizard steps. If you choose to install JRE, it will start automaticaly after installation.
2. Connect ARM-JTAG-OCD and install drivers.
 
 			PROJECT CREATION

1. Run the shortcut "Eclipse" on desktop.
2.Create new C project and name it after board you have// Open the project corresponding to the board you have, and open it's main.c file.
3. Create main.c file. There include LPC header file you need.If it does't fit to CPU, change header file according to CPU program model .
4. Create your own or modify previous existing .cmd file. This Linker Script defines how the code and data emitted by the GNU C compiler and assembler are  
 to be loaded into memory (code goes into FLASH, variables go into RAM). You should change MEMORY section and stack end according to memory map.
5.You should also need MAKEFILE to specify way of compilation. You may use old one or change it as suitable to you.
		After project is built you can debug it.

			PROGRAM DEBUG

1.Another file needed by GDB<-->OCD communication is .cfg file. It contains list of OCD commands
2. Switch to the Debug Perspective(Window->Show View->Debug)
3. Start OpenOCD program from Run -> External Tools -> OpenOCD or OpenOCDTiny 
4. Start the debugger from "Run->Open Debug Dialg->Embedded Debug(Cygwin)-><your prject debug profile>", "Debug"
5. Enjoy the demo.

Note! If at any point a message box pops-up stating that ${project_loc} is not defined, make sure that a file from the project is actually open and selected in the editor.
